We're running the <strong>GibsonAI OneShot Hackathon</strong> where the best prompt wins!</p>\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  What's New?\n</h2>\n\n<p>Last week we launched our MCP server to connect your preferred LLM/IDE to GibsonAI's backend databases. This week we're taking it to the masses with a hackathon designed for senior devs and vibe coders alike.</p>\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  The Challenge\n</h2>\n\n<p>The <strong>GibsonAI OneShot Hackathon</strong> presents a unique challenge: <strong>Create the most impressive, fully-functional application with the fewest possible AI prompts.</strong> Yeah, one shot is hard, so we have $1K for a 1-shot full stack app and the number of follow up prompts is a judging criteria.</p>\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  Using GibsonAI's MCP Server\n</h2>\n\n<p><strong>GibsonAI's MCP server</strong> is really the reason we are doing this hackathon. We want to get people using it and gather feedback so we can iterate and improve. That's why there's a $500 prize for most valuable feedback as well. </p>\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  Submission Requirements\n</h2>\n\n<p>Just use our MCP server, that's about it! You'll be submitting your prompt and your stack so we can try to replicate your app, and providing a video and code is always cool, too.</p>\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  Judging Criteria\n</h2>\n\n<p>We're assembling a panel of judges with expertise in AI, product management, investing, and engineering. They'll evaluate your submissions based on:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Prompt Efficiency (35%)</strong>: How much functionality achieved with how few prompts</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Functionality (25%)</strong>: Does the app work as intended and solve a real problem</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Design &amp; UX (15%)</strong>: Visual appeal and user experience</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Creativity (15%)</strong>: Originality and innovative use of GibsonAI</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Reproducibility (10%)</strong>: Success rate when recreating the app using your provided prompt and stack</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The judges will attempt to recreate your application using your submitted prompt(s) and development stack, so be sure to include accurate details about your environment and tools.</p>\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  You Don't Have To Win To Win\n</h2>\n\n<p>The top prize of $3,000, and there's $1K for the best one-shot app, but there is also and a $500 bonus if you refer the ultimate winner! </p>\n\n<p>Sign up at <strong><a href=\"https://hackathon.gibsonai.com\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">hackathon.gibsonai.com</a></strong> (the first \"entry\" in the contest, by the way) and get a shareable link. You can also see <strong>the prompt we designed to build the site</strong> (and yes, we had numerous follow-up prompts but the MVP worked!).</p>\n\n<p>Everyone who enters will also get three months free of GibsonAI's starter plan.</p>\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  Plenty of Time To Enter!\n</h2>\n\n<p>Submit your apps and prompts between now and <strong>May 4, 2025, 11:59 PM EST</strong> - Star Wars day! Feel free to refine your prompts and submit additional entries (up to three). We'll hold a webinar on May 15th to announce the winners, so get prompting!</p>\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  From Prompt To Prod To Profit!\n</h2>\n\n<p>Join the OneShot Hackathon post haste at <a href=\"https://hackathon.gibsonai.com\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">hackathon.gibsonai.com</a>, get your referral link, and demonstrate sick prompt engineering skills!</p>\n\n<p>Questions? We're <strong>always on our <a href=\"https://discord.gg/gibsonai\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Discord</a></strong> and will be monitoring it closely throughout the hackathon to support you.</p>",

That gives the thoughts about the actual dev.</p>\n\n<p>By the way, today I had no new idea but in the hackathon I collaborate with a new team who are creating a \"QUERY BUILDER\". The actual pipeline takes an input from user and matches the relevant scenario with the table headers in the database.</p>\n\n<p>This process gives the relevant columns and thereafter it writes the SQL query to retrieve the relevant answers based on the retrieved columns.</p>\n\n<p>This is the idea they had. In the hackathon they work in the backend using Flask and Gemini model for predicting the relevant query based on the user words.</p>\n\n<p>I work with them and create a new frontend interface with React and it's look like a typical chatbot interface.</p>\n\n<p>We couldn't integrate the frontend with Flask, but we found out the problem finally and also the given time was finished.</p>\n\n<p>Overall the experience very close to my profession.

    "description": "<blockquote>\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  \u2699\ufe0f Set the Scene\n</h2>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It all started with an open problem, a crew too stubborn to quit, and 24 hours to ship something real.</p>\n\n<p>We entered this <strong>national-level hackathon</strong> with a clear goal: to build something that didn\u2019t just work but mattered. The theme was <strong>Open Innovation</strong>, and while the freedom was exciting, we knew we had to be intentional. Instead of chasing trends, we focused on a problem that\u2019s real, relevant, and way too often ignored- <strong>waste management</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>That\u2019s how <strong>3RVision</strong> was born. An AI-powered platform designed to help users identify household waste and figure out whether it can be <em>reused, recycled, or resold</em>. It\u2019s a practical, user-focused solution for a global issue. Built with machine learning, clean UI, and an emphasis on sustainability, we aimed to make responsible living more accessible and a little bit smarter.</p>\n\n<p>We weren\u2019t trying to impress with flashy features we wanted to solve a real-world problem in a way that actually sticks.</p>\n\n<p>The 24 hours were intense. <strong>Between debugging models</strong>, <strong>designing flows</strong>, and <strong>juggling backend chaos</strong>, there were moments we genuinely thought we wouldn\u2019t make it in time. But somehow, everything clicked just enough in the final stretch. <strong>And yeah that last-minute demo that somehow actually worked?</strong> Definitely one for the memory books.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  \ud83d\udc65 The Dream Team\n</h2>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Every winning project needs a team that just <em>clicks</em>, and we had that from the jump.</p>\n\n<p>There weren\u2019t strict roles or <strong><em>\u201cyou do this, I do that</em></strong>\u201d energy. We were all in, all the time switching gears between frontend, backend, ML, and sometimes just keeping each other sane. Everyone wore multiple hats, and somehow, it worked.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p><a href=\"https://github.com/khushiiagrawal\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>Khushi</strong></a> \u2013 The <strong>team lead</strong> and the brain behind the idea. She steered <br />\nthe ship, worked on the ML side, and constantly pushed the UI to <br />\nlook and feel better. Super picky about the frontend\u2014and yeah, she <br />\nkept me on my toes with it \ud83d\ude2e\u200d\ud83d\udca8.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong><a href=\"https://github.com/Denyme24\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Naman (me)</a></strong> \u2013 Took charge of the <strong>frontend</strong>, handled components, API stuff, Authentication and also chipped in on the backend. Made sure everything worked like it should, visually and under the hood.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong><a href=\"https://github.com/Arpit529Srivastava\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Arpit</a></strong> \u2013 The utility player who pulled off two big wins building the <strong>Chrome extension</strong> and strengthening the backend. He was the kind of dev who quietly shipped features that just worked no fuss, no fluff, just clean execution.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong><a href=\"https://github.com/Shrey327\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Shreyansh</a></strong> \u2013 The wild card turned MVP. He went all-in on the ML side <strong>training our custom models</strong>, fine-tuning performance, and basically doing the kind of wizardry that made the AI magic real. He joined in a little later but made a massive impact in no time</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<blockquote>\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  \ud83c\udf31 Birth of 3RVision\n</h2>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The idea for <strong>3RVision</strong> came from a simple realization: there\u2019s a ton of waste out there, and people often don\u2019t know what to do with it. With increasing environmental concerns, we wanted to create a practical solution that helps people identify whether an item can be <strong>reused, recycled, or resold</strong> right from their phone.</p>\n\n<p>It was clear that the challenge of waste management wasn\u2019t just about <em>knowing</em> what could be recycled, but <em>how</em> to make it easy for people to make informed, eco-friendly decisions. So, we decided to tackle this with AI, combining image recognition to offer suggestions for each item whether it was fit for recycling, resale, or reuse.</p>\n\n<p>There were debates along the way could we expand beyond just waste management? Should we focus on something more abstract? But in the end, we locked onto this problem because it felt practical, relevant, and scalable. Plus, we could really make a difference with it. And let\u2019s be real, who doesn\u2019t love building something that can make a positive impact?</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  \ud83d\udee0\ufe0f Game Time \u2013 The Hack Begins\n</h2>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>We kicked off the hack with all the enthusiasm in the world. The morning went pretty smooth frontend coming together, models being trained, vibes were solid.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Khushi</strong> and <strong>Shreyansh</strong> were deep into training the core ML models, I was locking in the frontend, and <strong>Arpit was busy setting up the Chrome extension</strong> getting those early pieces in place so we could integrate it all later.</p>\n\n<p>Around evening, the organizers hit us with a surprise <strong>jamming session</strong> and not gonna lie, it was <em>exactly</em> what we needed. 10/10 would jam again.</p>\n\n<p>Now, back to the grind. Post-jam, things got a bit\u2026 spicy.</p>\n\n<p>There were some weird bugs in the extension it wasn\u2019t properly classifying items into <strong>degradable vs. biodegradable</strong>. <strong>Me and Arpit</strong> tag-teamed it and squashed that mess before dinner. Clean fix, good vibes</p>\n\n<p>But the real pain hit when <strong>Shreyansh\u2019s model training crashed</strong> network issues mid-process. Bro left it training during the jam, and came back to find everything wiped.

    "description": "<p>Hey Devs!<br />\nI recently participated in the \"Hack the Future: A GenAI Sprint\" Hackathon and built a solo project called GuardianAI \u2014 a lightweight multi-agent system that supports elderly care using AI.</p>\n\n<p>I\u2019m sharing my journey in this post \u2014 from idea to last-minute submission, everything I learned, and how it helped me grow as a builder. If you're into AI, Python, or hackathons, this one's for you.</p>\n\n<p>The Problem:<br />\nHow can we use GenAI to support elderly individuals in managing their health, daily routines, and emergencies?</p>\n\n<p>With rising concerns about elderly safety and independence, I found this challenge both meaningful and technically interesting.<br />\n My Solution: GuardianAI<br />\nI built GuardianAI, a command-line AI system powered by three agents working together:</p>\n\n<p>\ud83d\udc93 Health Monitor Agent \u2013 Analyzes vitals like heart rate, BP, and flags anomalies.</p>\n\n<p>\u23f0 Reminder Agent \u2013 Displays personalized daily tasks like medication and hydration.</p>\n\n<p>\ud83d\udea8 Alert Agent \u2013 Collects alerts and shows emergency warnings.</p>\n\n<p>Each agent uses real-time data from CSV files and communicates via Python functions \u2014 a clean, modular architecture.</p>\n\n<p>\ud83d\udee0\ufe0f Tech Stack<br />\nPython 3.11</p>\n\n<p>pandas</p>\n\n<p>CLI (Command Line Interface)</p>\n\n<p>GitHub (for version control + hosting)</p>\n\n<p>YouTube + OneDrive (for final demo &amp; slides)</p>\n\n<p>I kept it simple \u2014 no flashy web app, just a clear proof of concept.</p>\n\n<p>\ud83d\udcc2 GitHub Repo<br />\nFull code, agents, data files, and PPT:<br />\n\ud83d\udd17 GitHub \u2013 [<a href=\"https://github.com/AstutiJ/-AstutiJ-Elderly-Care-AI-Hackathon-Project/commit/bb494faeaea79f4a45b04dc1c90e3cc8b7819967\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://github.com/AstutiJ/-AstutiJ-Elderly-Care-AI-Hackathon-Project/commit/bb494faeaea79f4a45b04dc1c90e3cc8b7819967</a>]</p>\n\n<p>\ud83d\udcad What I Learned<br />\nStart, even if it\u2019s messy or rushed.</p>\n\n<p>Build for impact, not just for flash.</p>\n\n<p>Agent-based thinking is powerful in AI architecture.</p>\n\n<p>Solo building can teach you more than team projects sometimes!</p>\n\n<p>\ud83d\udc9a The Bigger Win<br />\nEven if I don\u2019t win a prize, this project gave me real confidence. It re-sparked my motivation to continue my 90 Days of DevOps blog series \u2014 which I had paused due to illness.</p>\n\n<p>This blog marks my comeback \u2014 and I\u2019m super excited to keep building, learning, and sharing.</p>\n\n<p>\ud83d\udc4b Final Thoughts<br />\nIf you\u2019ve ever felt like you're not \"ready\" for a hackathon, I promise \u2014 you\u2019ll learn more by showing up and trying than by waiting.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks for reading, and feel free to check out my project repo, video, or connect here!</p>",

If you\u2019ve ever said:</p>\n\n<p>\"Why is this still so slow?\"</p>\n\n<p>\"Why isn\u2019t there an app for this?\"</p>\n\n<p>\"Why do people still use paper for this?\"</p>\n\n<p>Then congratulations \u2014 you\u2019ve encountered a problem worth solving.</p>\n\n<p><strong>## \ud83d\udca1 From Problem to Project</strong></p>\n\n<p>Here are a few ways problem solving business ideas start in the real world:</p>\n\n<p>A high school student noticed her mom forgetting medication \u2192 Built a pill reminder app.</p>\n\n<p>Engineering grads saw water wastage in fields \u2192 Made an automated irrigation system.</p>\n\n<p>Someone\u2019s Wi-Fi kept going down during online classes \u2192 Built a self-rebooting Wi-Fi watchdog.</p>\n\n<p>None of these were built with business in mind. But they addressed world problems that need to be solved \u2014 and that\u2019s where good dev projects live.</p>\n\n<p><strong>## \ud83d\udd0d What Kind of Projects Are We Talking About?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Let\u2019s get specific:</p>\n\n<p>Project Type    Real Problem Tackled<br />\nIoT-based Smart Helmet  No helmet, no ignition \u2014 saves lives<br />\nWeb App for Farmer Markets  No digital access in rural commerce<br />\nPython Tool for Blind Students  Converts text to voice using camera input<br />\nLow-Cost Air Quality Monitor    Real-time pollution data for low-income areas<br />\nThese started as engineering college projects, but with the right mindset, they\u2019re startup MVPs in disguise.</p>\n\n<p><strong>## \ud83d\udc68\u200d\ud83d\udcbb Devs: You Already Have the Skills</strong></p>\n\n<p>Most developers underestimate their daily skills. You write scripts, automate things, build UIs, and make systems smarter.</p>\n\n<p>Why not apply those same skills to a student engineering project idea that impacts lives?</p>\n\n<p>Build open-source versions of overpriced tools.</p>\n\n<p>Help local communities automate boring workflows.</p>\n\n<p>Partner with NGOs or schools that need tech but lack devs.</p>\n\n<p>Even if you never launch a company, the project becomes your real-world portfolio.</p>\n\n<p><strong>## \ud83c\udf10 Where to Start?</strong></p>\n\n<p>That\u2019s where <strong><a href=\"https://innovationforu.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">InnovationForU.com</a></strong> fits in.</p>\n\n<p>It\u2019s a collection of real problems \u2014 not made-up startup prompts \u2014 that students and creators can explore. No hype, just opportunities. Use them to build your next hackathon project, capstone assignment, or side hustle.</p>\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  <strong>\u2699\ufe0f Final Take</strong>\n</h2>\n\n<p>Every time you ask, \u201cWhy hasn\u2019t anyone fixed this yet?\u201d \u2014 that\u2019s your cue.</p>\n\n<p>The gap between a class project and a funded startup isn\u2019t always that big. It\u2019s usually just:</p>\n\n<p>Solving something real</p>\n\n<p>Sharing it publicly</p>\n\n<p>Iterating based on feedback</p>\n\n<p>You don\u2019t need VC funding. You need curiosity and a bit of code.</p>\n\n<p>**</p>\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  \u2728 TL;DR\n</h2>\n\n<p>**<br />\nReal problems &gt; random ideas</p>\n\n<p>Your skills as a developer are enough to start</p>\n\n<p>Projects can become businesses \u2014 if they solve real pain</p>\n\n<p>Innovation starts with empathy, not just code</p>\n\n<p>Want ideas to get started?
